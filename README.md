# COVID-19-Sentiment-Analysis
This exercise was undertaken in order to enhance my skills in Pythxon. 

Data is pulled from the Coronavirus subreddit and is analyzed using nltk library. Visualization is done using plotly library. 

The final product of this analysis can be found at: https://www.allysonenglish.io/craftsmanship/

Next steps: using dummy data, explore how often the nltk function returns false negatives and false positives to determine the sensitivity of the analysis. 
Create SQL database to store data and refactor script to dynamically collect data only for days not already included in the database.
